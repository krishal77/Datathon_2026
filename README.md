# Datathon_2026
This project is a part of a datathon focused on predicting health risk classes from given climate + socioeconomic + health indices features.  
We used data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a Random Forest model, which gave the best performance.  
The model can predict health risk classes to help identify individuals at higher health risk for early intervention.
